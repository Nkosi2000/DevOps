<h2>Diving into the World of DevOps</h2>
</div>
<strong>
    DevOps is a set of practices, tools, and a cultural philosophy that automates and integrates the processes between software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). 
    Its goal is to help organizations deliver applications and services at high velocity, improving and evolving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development 
    and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.

    <p>Cultural DevOps Approach</p>
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Collaboration</strong> - DevOps fosters a culture of collaboration between teams that traditionally functioned in <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/25939/silo">silos</a>, namely development, operations, and quality assurance. The idea is to align all teams towards a common goal of delivering high-quality software rapidly.
</p> 
<p><strong>Ownership and Accountability</strong> - Teams own the lifecycle of their products. They are responsible for everything from development to deployment and monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>Automation</strong> - <a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/what-is-ci-cd-devops">Continuous Integration (CI):</a> This involves automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. The goal is to identify and fix issues early by frequently merging changes into a central repository.
    
<a href="https://www.educative.io/blog/what-is-ci-cd-devops">Continuous Delivery (CD):</a> Building upon CI, CD ensures that code changes are automatically prepared for release to production. This includes automated testing, environment provisioning, and even deployment.

<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/cloud-computing/infrastructure-as-code">Infrastructure as Code (IaC):</a> This practice involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable configuration files, rather than through physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. Tools like Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Ansible are commonly used for IaC.</p>

<div class="tool-section">
    <h3><span class="icon">ðŸ”§</span> Tools:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Version Control Systems (VCS): Git is the most popular VCS used in DevOps for managing and tracking changes in code.</li>
        <li>CI/CD Tools: Jenkins, Travis CI, CircleCI, and GitLab CI/CD are some popular tools used to implement CI/CD pipelines.</li>
        <li>Configuration Management Tools: Tools like Puppet, Chef, and Ansible help automate the setup of infrastructure and manage its configuration.</li>
        <li>Containerization: Docker is a widely used tool that allows developers to package applications into containers, which are lightweight, standalone, and can be run consistently across multiple environments.</li>
        <li>Orchestration: Kubernetes is the leading orchestration tool for managing containers at scale. It automates the deployment, scaling, and operation of application containers.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>DevOps Lifecycle</h2>

<div class="devops-lifecycle">
    <div class="devops-step"><h3>Plan</h3> <>Defining and planning features and functionalities of the application.</div>
    <div class="devops-step"><h3>Code</h3>Writing and managing the source code.</div>
    <div class="devops-step"><h3>Build</h3>Compiling the code into binaries or packages that can be deployed.</div>
    <div class="devops-step"><h3>Test</h3>Automated testing to ensure code is functioning as expected.</div>
    <div class="devops-step"><h3>Release</h3>Code is tested, verified, and released to production.</div>
    <div class="devops-step"><h3>Deploy</h3>The process of deploying the application to production environments.</div>
    <div class="devops-step"><h3>Operate</h3>Monitoring the application post-deployment.</div>
    <div class="devops-step"><h3>Monitor</h3>Continuous monitoring to detect and address issues.</div>
