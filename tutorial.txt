Hereâ€™s a detailed step-by-step tutorial outlining the process we followed to set up your GitLab CI/CD pipeline with Docker integration:

Step-by-Step Process
Project Initialization:

Started with an existing GitLab project named "DevOps."
Defined the need for Docker integration to automate the build and deployment process.
Creating the Dockerfile:

Created a Dockerfile in the project root.
Defined the base image (e.g., FROM node:14).
Set the working directory (WORKDIR /app).
Added commands to copy package files and install dependencies (COPY package*.json ./ and RUN npm install).
Included a command to start the application (e.g., CMD ["npm", "start"]).
Initial Pipeline Setup:

Created a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the project root.
Defined the stages: build, test, and deploy.
Defining Jobs:

Build Job:
Added a job named build job under the build stage.
Included echo statements to simulate the building process of different application pages.
Test Job:
Added a job named test job under the test stage.
Included echo statements to simulate testing different application pages.
Deploy Job:
Added a job named deploy job under the deploy stage.
Included echo statements to simulate the deployment process.
Incorporating Docker Commands:

Attempted to add a verifybuild job to check if the Docker image exists and build it if not.
Included conditional logic to build the Docker image only if it didn't exist.
Encountering Errors:

Faced issues when the GitLab runner couldn't find the Docker command.
Adjusted the runner settings to ensure the correct Docker executor was used.
Refining the Pipeline:

Removed unnecessary commented-out code to simplify the .gitlab-ci.yml configuration.
Focused on the active jobs: build, test, and deploy.
Finalizing the Pipeline Structure:

Confirmed the current pipeline included the three main stages without any redundant or commented-out sections.
Ensured that the build and deployment processes were clear and ready for further enhancements.
Next Steps:

Discussed future improvements, such as adding automated testing and more robust deployment processes.
This detailed outline covers all the key steps we took to establish your GitLab CI/CD pipeline with Docker integration.
